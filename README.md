1LineLinux
==========

One Line Linux is inspired by @pkrumins one line script. It is a collection of the Linux command and concepts in one line.

I am not the author of most of the one line scripts. Rather, I found it some time back at http://www.catonmat.net/ and wanted to see it available on GitHub.

All credit and praise for authoring this script should go to Peteris Krumins.
